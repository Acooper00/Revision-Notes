	~Forces
		An object is in equilibrium if the resultant force and resultant moment on the object is 0
		~Resolving Forces
		A force can be split into its horizontal and vertical components by multiplying the force by the cosine and sine of the angle between the force and the horizontal
		~Moment
		The moment on an object is equal to the turning effect on the object
		M = F x d
